# Final
gfx final project.
Before first run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To create the solar system animation:
```
make run
```
Warning: this might crash depending on stuff. If it does, try
```
make runblock block=N
```
with N starting at 150, and being smaller and smaller until it works.
